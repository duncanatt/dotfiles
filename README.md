# Yet another dotfiles! 

Like others that may be found on-line, this dotfiles collection tries to make the process of setting up a new macOS installation as painless as possible. 

To use, `chmod +x` the `.install.sh` file and run:
```
$ ./install.sh
```

My particular requirements mean that the `install.sh` script performs some tool-specific configurations targeting GIT and Erlang. Feel free to modify `install.sh` as required.

I would like to acknowledge the fact that while building this dotfiles collection, I heavily referred to dotfiles and related resources written by others:
* [Setting up a Brand New Mac for Development](https://www.taniarascia.com/setting-up-a-brand-new-mac-for-development/)
* [Getting Started with Dotfiles](https://driesvints.com/blog/getting-started-with-dotfiles/)
* [https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)

I have borrowed ideas from the above links and modified them to suit my needs. Some of the things I left out, either because these were too much or because I required something specific to my setup. Mistakes or inadequacies in the scripts and files in this repo are entirely my own fault.
